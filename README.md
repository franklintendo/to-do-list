# Render Todos

In this activity you will be writing code to render an array of todo items to the list.

## Instructions

* Open the `script.js` file provided to you. You have been provided the necessary variable declarations as well as an array of todo items.

* Your goal is to create a function that will render our todos into a list in the browser.

  * Initially set the text content of the todoList to an empty string.
  
  * todoCountSpan should show the total count of todos on the page.
  
* Inside of your render function you will also need a for loop.

  * It should loop over the `todos` array creating an `li` element for each index of the array.
  
  * It should set the content of the created `li` element to the value of the current array index.
  
  * Finally the new `li` should be appended to the `ul` provided.



# Add ToDo's

In this activity, we will be continuing to build on our Todo activity. This time, we'll be adding the `add` functionality.

## Instructions

* Add an event listener so that when a user hits enter, the value from the todo input field is pushed to our todo array.

* Make sure that empty values are not pushed to the array.

* Once the value has been added to the array, clear the input field and re-render the todo list.

# Complete Todos

In this activity, we will create a "complete" button that successfully removes a todo item from the list when clicked.

## Instructions

* Modify your `renderTodos()` function:

  * When a new todo is created, add a `data-index` for each `li`.

  * Generate a button that says "Complete" and append it to your `li`.

* Add an event listener so that when a user clicks the Complete button, it accesses the `data-index` value and removes that todo element from the list.

## Hint

* You can use `setAttribute` for `data-index` and `splice` to remove your todo from the list.
